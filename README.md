# LearningPython
I had my elective in my 6th semester as <b> python </b>,where I learned all the basics while made me enthusiastic
and in addition to that I did my coding training provide by my college in python language.
Today onwards I am going to corn my skills in python since I see my future in it.
As part of I will be completing codes based on random questions on the difficulty basis
